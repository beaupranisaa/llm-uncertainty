Although option B offers a higher potential payout for the top prize, the probabilities are less favorable overall.\n\nIn terms of my DESIRE, I value consistency and predictability. Even though option B has a higher potential win, the majority of outcomes result in a lower payout. Option A, on the other hand, offers a more balanced distribution of winnings.\n\nMy INTENTION is to maximize my chances of winning while still aiming for a reasonable payout. Considering the probabilities and potential payouts, I intend to select the option that provides the best balance of these factors.\n\nFinally, I will choose option A."
